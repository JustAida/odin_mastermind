# Make Mastermind module that contains 3 classes: Game, Player, Computer

# Player class will have to guess the code until it matches or run out of guesses.
# It can also decide whether to be the codemaker or codebreaker.
# If codemaker is chosen then it'll ask for the secret code.
# If codebreaker is chosen then it'll ask for the guesses.

# Computer class will have two roles as well, codebreaker or codemaker.
# If codebreaker then it'll try to guess the code using an algorithm.
# If codemaker then it'll choose the secret code randomly.

module Mastermind
  # Red, Green, Blue, Pink, Yellow, Orange
  COLOURS = %w[R G B P Y O]

  # Game class will display the board that contains 12 rows with 4 holes each.
  # It will be played 12 turns, and it'll give information after each guess.
  # Information: Red Pegs indicate correct positions and colours while,
  #   White Pegs indicate correct colours but not the positions.
  # The game will stop if the guess is equal to the secret code or run out of guesses.
  # The secret code will be 4 colours out of 6 colours, for example [R-G-B-P].
  # The colours are [R, G, B, P, Y, O] -> [Red, Green, Blue, Pink, Yellow, Orange].
