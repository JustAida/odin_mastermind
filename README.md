# odin_mastermind
This project is the command line version of the board game [mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))
It'll demonstrate that I have learned how to:
- Make module
- Make class
- Make the classes interact with each other
- Make an algorithm to make the Computer guess the code.

If there's anything wrong with the code that I overlooked please let me know. All feedbacks are very apprecaiated.
